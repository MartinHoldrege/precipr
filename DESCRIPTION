Title: Manipulating and examining precipitation intensity
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Martin Holdrege
Maintainer: Martin Holdrege <martinholdrege@gmail.com>
Description: Just a collection of some simple R functions that are useful to me 
    in manipulating precipitation, and for providing metrics of precipitation
    intensity. I will use these inside the rSFSTEP2 wrapper when running 
    simulations with increased intensity.
